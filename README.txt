Programming Assignment 3

How to compile and run:
To compile the code, just type 'make' within the project directory to use
the included makefile.
To run the program, type:
java ShortestPaths <input_file_name> <source_node> <k_value>

No external dependencies need to be satisfied for compiling and running
the code.

All output from the program, including any error messages due to providing
a source node that is not in the graph or providing an invalid k value, is
printed to the file "out.txt".
